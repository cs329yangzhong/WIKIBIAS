---- INTRO ----

This is the Wikipedia Neutrality Corpus accompanying AAAI-20 submission:
     "Automatically Neutralizing Subjective Bias in Text"

It consists of Pre- and post- sentences from Wikipedia revisions that
enforced Wikipedia's NPOV policy
(see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). 


---- CONTENTS ----

Files are 

WNC: the Wikipedia edits.
    * biased.all     -- all edits.
    * biased.word.*  -- word-level edits.
    * unbiased       -- neighbors of edited sentences.

real_world_samples: real world instances of bias.
    * ibc_*          -- political literature 
      		     	(see: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1105/).
    * speeches       -- Samples from campaign speeches of President Donald 
      		     	Trump. Obtained from www.kaggle.com/binksbiz/mrtrump.
    * news_*         -- Headlines of news articles identifed as biased 
      		     	according to mediabiasfactcheck.com.

bert.vocab: WordPiece vocabulary used for tokenization.

revision_topics.csv: A CSV containing a distribution over topics for the 
		     parent page of each revision. These distributions are
		     predicted by the Wikimedia foundation's categorization 
		     models. For more information see
		     https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3274290.

                     
---- FORMAT ----

All data files are TSVs with the following columns:
    id    src_tok	tgt_tok	src_raw	tgt_raw	src_POS_tags	tgt_parse_tags

For wiki-derived files, "id" is the diff id of the associated revision,
so the id's are not nessicarily unique for each example.

For example, an id of 532355971 would map to 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=532355971
